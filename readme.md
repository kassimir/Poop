This is my foray into trying to build my own language. It was just a side project to learn more about the inner workings of Javascript and how language transpiling works (to some extent).

Currently there isn't a whole lot you can do, but I wanted my Poop to be the stupidest, crappiest language ever. That's why I built it for everything to be on one page in a .poop file. There is an example with the code, but here it is:

```
poo _destination World!
poo _name Poop!

beginning Hello

poop beginning
  shit
    h1 class=highlight arg1 _destination /h1
    h2 class=bold And welcome to _name /h2
  flush
  
  shit p This is a dook p block! :D /p
flush<br>
```

That turns out looking like this:

I don't have math working yet. It *was* working, but I messed it up somehow. At any rate, don't expect this to get updated much.
